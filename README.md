## why django

First of all, we need to know that Django and the rest of the framework are
just tools, which we use to achieve our goal.
Each of these tools has features and there weaknesses, and so on So you have
to decide for yourself which tool works best for you, I'll mention five good
features of Django here, but Django has more good features that you need to
know.

- Ridiculously fast.
  - Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to
    completion as quickly as possible.

- Reassuringly secure.
  - Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common
    security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting,
    cross-site request forgery and clickjacking. Its user authentication
    system provides a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords.

- Exceedingly scalable.
  - Some of the busiest sites on the planet use Djangoâ€™s ability to quickly
    and flexibly scale to meet the heaviest traffic demands.

- Fully loaded.
  - Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common web
    development tasks. Django takes care of user authentication, content
    administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks right
    out of the box.

- Incredibly versatile.
  - Companies, organizations and governments have used Django to build all
    sorts of things from content management systems to social networks to
    scientific computing platforms.
